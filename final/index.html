		<h1>CS184 Final Project Proposal</h1>
		<h1>Realistic Firework Rendering/Simulation</h1>

		<h2>Summary</h2>
		<p>We aim to make a renderer that can produce realistic looking videos/gifs of fireworks lighting up nearby objects like
			water, buildings,
			etc as they are fired into the air and then deflagrate.</p>
	</div>


	<h2>Problem Description:</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Problem 1: Simulate a realistic firework
			<ul>
				<li>Potential solution: simulate the firework particles’ dynamics (shapes, trails, mousing, blinking)</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Problem 2: Dynamically lighting the surrounding objects as the firework is shot
			<ul>
				<li>Potential solution: blending and mixing lights from multiple sources (light sources + reflective sources + brightness +
				color)</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Goals and Deliverables:</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>We plan to deliver a simulation capable of producing a video/gif of one firework being shot up, exploding, and lighting
		up its surroundings (water and metal buildings) along the way. If things go ahead of schedule, we hope to be able to
		produce videos with multiple fireworks of different colors being shot at different times, along with many additional
		surroundings (grass, dirt, glass/concrete buildings). We will measure the quality/performance of our deliverable by
		comparing its realism to actual videos of fireworks in similar environments, along with the smoothness of the video/gif
		(frames per second).</li>
		<li>Most of the questions that we receive from the presentation may be related to the particle effects/physics of the
		firework, since it will expand the topic of particle systems from lecture and Project 4.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Schedule:</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Week 1: Firework light source completed</li>
		<li>Week 2: Surroundings implemented + properly lit by firework light source (direct + indirect lighting)</li>
		<li>Week 3: Scene is fully animated (firework movement, explosion, and lighting)</li>
		<li>Week 4: (If time permits) multiple fireworks at once + additional surroundings implemented</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Resources:</h2>
	<p>There are two potential directions we could go. The first would be to use Project 3-1 as a starting point, and then
	create a video by taking many screen shots at different times and stitching them together. The pros of this would be
	that we’re familiar with the codebase, but the cons would be that it may be more difficult to code a firework in this
	environment, given its complexity. The other direction would be to use an engine like Unity. This would make it easier
	for us to make animated things like fireworks and water effects, but would be more difficult to learn since none of us
	have experience using Unity.</p>
