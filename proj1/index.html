		<h2>Task 1</h2>
			<h3>Things we didn’t take into account/problems encountered and solved:</h3>
			<p>clockwise + counter clockwise (fixed with counter if statement), occasional out of bounds pixels colored in (fixed by
			removing rasterize_line lines of code), occasional blank spaces right before bounds (changed for statements to start
			with floats at 0.5 instead of accounting for that right at the end in rasterize_point)</p>
			<h3>Deliverables:</h3>
			<p>We rasterize a triangle by sampling points at fixed distances that lay inside the bounds of a triangle. In our case,
			with a sample rate of 1, that would mean valid points would each be 1 x and y y unit apart. You can ensure all of the
			sample points are in bounds of the triangle by running 3 line tests.</p>
			<p>Our algorithm is no worse than one that checks each sample within the bounding box of the triangle because that is
			exactly what it does. Based on the edges of the triangle, we look at the points within a minimum area square around the
			triangle, and only sample the points that are in the bounds of the triangle, as per the 3 line tests.</p>

			<h3>Deliverables:</h3>
			<p>The idea of barycentric coordinates is very closely related to the concept of “change of basis” that we have learned in
			the EECS16A/B series. Say you have a point in triangle ABC at location (x, y), and we want to get the related point
			location for that some location in triangle VaVbVc. Barycentric coordinates allow us to transform (x,y) in the ABC
			domain into (u,v) in the VaVbVc domain.</p>

			<p>asdfasdf</p>
			<h3>Deliverables:</h3>
			<p>When you’re rasterizing textured shapes, you can go about sampling texture values in a couple ways. First, if you sample
			pixels using nearest-pixel sampling, you simply pick the texture sample closest to the point you’re trying to sample and
			add its color value to the sample buffer. Instead, if you sample pixels using bilinear sampling, you look at the 4
			nearest samples, calculate each of their relative distances from the location you’re trying to sample, then run 2D
			linear interpolation on those 4 points, using their relative distances as weights. Add the output color of that
			calculation to the sample buffer.</p>
			<img src='./images/task5.png' width='800'>
			<p>Top Left: nearest pixel, sample rate 1, Top Right: nearest pixel, sample rate 16, Bottom Left: bilinear, sample rate 1,
			Bottom Right: bilinear, sample rate 16</p>
			<p>Relative differences: For the orange part of the texture for nearest pixel, there is a lot of randomness with the shades
			of each pixel, while bilinear is a lot more smoother and constant in color. Additionally, the bilinear sampled picture
			both look a bit more “blurry” than their nearest sample counterparts.</p>
