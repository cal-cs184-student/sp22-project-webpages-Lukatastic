		<h1>CS184 Project 1</h1>
		<h2>Task 1</h2>
			<h3>Things we didn’t take into account/problems encountered and solved:</h3>
			<p>clockwise + counter clockwise (fixed with counter if statement), occasional out of bounds pixels colored in (fixed by
			removing rasterize_line lines of code), occasional blank spaces right before bounds (changed for statements to start
			with floats at 0.5 instead of accounting for that right at the end in rasterize_point)</p>
			<h3>Deliverables:</h3>
			<p>We rasterize a triangle by sampling points at fixed distances that lay inside the bounds of a triangle. In our case,
			with a sample rate of 1, that would mean valid points would each be 1 x and y y unit apart. You can ensure all of the
			sample points are in bounds of the triangle by running 3 line tests.</p>
			<p>Our algorithm is no worse than one that checks each sample within the bounding box of the triangle because that is
			exactly what it does. Based on the edges of the triangle, we look at the points within a minimum area square around the
			triangle, and only sample the points that are in the bounds of the triangle, as per the 3 line tests.</p>
